# Hacker News Scraper

The Hacker News Scraper is a Python terminal application that allows users to view posts from Y Combinator's Hacker News. Hacker News is a news site focusing on computer science and entrepreneurship. Users can see their desired amount of posts and post information from either the "trending" or "newest" pages of the website. 

This application runs in Code Institute's mock terminal on Heroku.
